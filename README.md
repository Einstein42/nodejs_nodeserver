# nodejs_nodeserver
NodeJS Nodeserver wrapper for UDI Polyglot

I need to update this, but the package.json is up to date, and there are notes in the code.

This works for both MQTT and STDIN/STDOUT

In the server.json file, set the interface to mqtt for MQTT or anything else for STDIN/STDOUT.

After you clone this repo do a 'npm install' in the cloned directory to get all the dependencies.
